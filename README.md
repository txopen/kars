Development of a Kidney Allocation Rules Simulator application (KARS app) that allows simulations on deceased donor kidneys distributions in different waiting lists.

b.	KARS app allows not only testing current kidney allocation models, as well as testing changes in existing models so that we can understand how this can influence organs’ distribution
